Backup Feed
===========

New in Benchmark 1.2.1, the 
*TrueFX-Beantrader* server provides the same market data provided by the *TrueFX* server. It provides a backup feed for use when the main server is unavailable (e.g. during weekend maintenance).

.. note::
   The backup feed will 
   **not** automatically be used if the main server is offline, it must be explicitly configured in the Preferences (or Options) dialog box.


To switch to the backup feed
----------------------------

1. From the main menu bar

   * **Mac users**: select **Preferences** from the **Benchmark** menu
   * **Windows/Linux users**: select **Options** from the **Feed** menu

2. Locate the **Server** combobox or drop down

   * to use the backup feed select **TrueFX-Beantrader**, or
   * to use the main feed select **TrueFX**.

3. Select **OK** to apply the changes.
